## Description

- The motivation behind this project was streamline buiding Readme's.
- This project allowed me to practice using node module's, which specifically were Inquirer and JS.
- The problem with building a README for every repo is that it takes up too much time, this elimates that problem.
- I learned how to use Inquirer and to write a file from scratch using JS.
